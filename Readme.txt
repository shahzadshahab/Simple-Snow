== Description ==

**Simple Snow** adds a beautiful, elegant snowfall animation to your WordPress site during the winter or holiday season — without slowing it down.

- **No clutter** — only one simple setting.

You can enable a light or dark color profile so the snow remains visible on all theme backgrounds.

Yes. The canvas automatically scales and adjusts density.
